                    Today marks my first day of learning web development. In middle school I took my first HTML class and enjoyed it but never fully pursued it as a professional path. I remember ny dad had even bought me a book on HTML and a license to the web development tool Adobe Dreamweaver. I've come back to web development many years later to build a specific marketable skill. Of course, part of the reason is also for personal enjoyment. There are many things I have wanted to create over the years (mostly video game related) but have not had the skills. This blog will help me to stay accountable in my web development journey. I have chosen to start my journey with the <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/learn/beginner/" target="_blank">FrontendMasters Beginner Path</a>. More specifically, I am starting with the <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-development-v3/" target="_blank">Complete Intro to Web Development, v3</a> from <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/brian-holt/" target="_blank">Brian Holt</a>. The main topics are below. Wish me luck!
