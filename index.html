                    Today marks my first day of learning web development. In middle school I took my first HTML class and enjoyed it but never fully pursued it as a professional path. I remember ny dad had even bought me a book on HTML and a license to the web development tool Adobe Dreamweaver. I've come back to web development many years later to build a specific marketable skill. Of course, part of the reason is also for personal enjoyment. There are many things I have wanted to create over the years (mostly video game related) but have not had the skills. This blog will help me to stay accountable in my web development journey. I have chosen to start my journey with the <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/learn/beginner/" target="_blank">FrontendMasters Beginner Path</a>. More specifically, I am starting with the <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-development-v3/" target="_blank">Complete Intro to Web Development, v3</a> from <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/brian-holt/" target="_blank">Brian Holt</a>. The main topics are below. Wish me luck!

                    Update: I got through the HTML and CSS portion of the learning path. The HTML project was the home page and blog of this site. The CSS site is <a href="Projects\Complete-Intro-to-Web-Dev-V3\Coffee Masters\index.html" target="_blank">Coffee Masters</a>. I ended up spending a few hours on it. From just a few hours of learning it was very hard to recreate it. What I ended up doing was struggling a bit and then coming back to it and building it section by section based on the source html/css from Brian. Maybe I will come back to it in the future and try and create something similar without looking at his source code.
